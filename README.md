Practice: SQL - 1 - SQL User Management Operations
This SQL practice on database operations like 
inserting, 
updating, 
deleting, and 
querying user data. 

I practiced writing conditional, sorted, and limited queries to simulate real-world use cases.

The most challenging part was ensuring queries were logically ordered and syntactically correct when combining WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT clauses.
