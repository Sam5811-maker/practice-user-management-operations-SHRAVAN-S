This exercise helped me deepen my understanding of JOINs, aggregate functions, and filtering with WHERE, HAVING, and subqueries. 
I have practiced writing complex queries.

The most challenging part was designing subqueries that work seamlessly with GROUP BY logic. 
It was rewarding to see the results after fine-tuning several times.
